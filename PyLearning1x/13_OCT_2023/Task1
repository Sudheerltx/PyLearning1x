1.      Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
Ans:    '='  is an assignment operator.
        ex: a = 5, here integer '5' is assigned to the variable named "a"

        whereas '==' is an operator to compare 2 values
        ex: a = 5
        if(a == 5):  --> Here the value in variable a is compared with integer 5 and returns True if equal else returns false
            print(True)
        else:
            print(False)

2.      What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
Ans:    ** is an exponentiation (power of) operator
        ex: 2**3 returns 8. Here 2**3 means (2 power of 3) or (2 cube) or (2 x 2 x 2) i.e multiplying 2, 3 times

3.      What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
Ans:    ^ is a bitwise XOR operator. used to toggle a bit i.e to change a bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.
